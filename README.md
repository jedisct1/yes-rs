# yes-rs 🚀

> A blazingly fast, memory-safe rewrite of the classic Unix `yes` command

## Why rewrite `yes` in Rust? 🤔

Because the original `yes` command (written in _shudders_ C) is:

- ❌ Not memory-safe
- ❌ Prone to buffer overflows
- ❌ Lacks modern error handling
- ❌ Missing zero-cost abstractions
- ❌ No fearless concurrency
- ❌ Not written in Rust

## Features ✨

- 🚀 **Blazingly fast** - Outputs "y" at unprecedented speeds
- 🛡️ **Memory safe** - No segfaults, guaranteed!
- ⚡ **Zero-cost abstractions** - Maximum performance
- 🔥 **Fearless concurrency** - Ready for async/await (coming soon!)
- 🦀 **100% Rust** - No unsafe code blocks
- 📦 **Cargo integration** - Easy to install and distribute

## Installation 📦

```bash
cargo install yes-rs
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jedisct1/yes-rs
cd yes-rs
cargo build --release
```

## Usage 💻

Just like the original `yes`, but better:

```bash
# Output "y" forever (blazingly fast!)
yes-rs

# Output custom string forever (memory-safe!)
yes-rs "hello rust"
```

## Benchmarks 📊

| Command     | Language | Lines of Code | Memory Safety | Speed            |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `yes` (GNU) | C        | ~50           | ❌            | Fast             |
| `yes-rs`    | Rust 🦀  | ~1302         | ✅            | **BLAZING FAST** |

## Contributing 🤝

We welcome contributions! Please ensure all code is:

- ✅ Written in Rust
- ✅ Memory-safe
- ✅ Blazingly fast

## Share the Rust Revolution 🦀

Think this project deserves more recognition? **Share it on Hacker News!**

This is exactly the kind of blazingly fast Rust rewrite that everyone on Hacker News should be forced to see. Help spread awareness about it.

**Suggested HN title:**

- "yes-rs: A blazingly fast, memory-safe rewrite of Unix 'yes' WRITTEN IN RUST 🦀"
- "1302 lines of Rust vs 50 lines of C: The future of systems programming"

_Because if it's not written in Rust, it's not worth using._ 🦀
